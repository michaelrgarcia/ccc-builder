# ccc-builder

I give my thanks to [Prajwal](https://github.com/kidkoder432) for single-handedly creating the [backend](https://github.com/kidkoder432/ccc-builder-backend).

CCCBuilder is a tool designed to help students in California Community Colleges (CCCs) create schedules for transferring to any institution in the UC, CSU, or AICCU system.

**This tool does not intend to take on the role of an academic counselor.**
