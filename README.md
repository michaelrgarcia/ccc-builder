# ccc-builder

Thanks to [Prajwal](https://github.com/kidkoder432) for creating a [substantial part](https://github.com/kidkoder432/ccc-builder-backend) of the backend.

CCCBuilder is a tool designed to help students in California Community Colleges (CCCs) create schedules that allow them to transfer to any institution in the UC, CSU, or AICCU system.
Schedules consist of the minimum amount of courses needed in order to satisfy all specified transfer requirements (course difficulty will not be taken into consideration).

**This tool does not intend to take on the role of an academic counselor.**
